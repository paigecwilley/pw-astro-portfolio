## Engineered to protect $$$ in employment.

Remote.com provides a full suite of HR, payroll, hiring, and contractor invoicing services. I'm an engineer on the fraud and risk team. I make sure companies don't lose money to fraud and people get paid for the work they do.

There's a lot I _can't_ say about my fraud and risk work. Keeping the tricks of the trade close to the chest is, well, one of the tricks of the trade. But you can see some of the areas I cover below!

### Credit-risk

Through automation with third-party vendors and internal workflows, I've saved the company $21M in MRR and drastically cut our risk of exposure.

### KYB and KYC

I've built internal tools to make sure companies, employees, and contractors are who they say they are. I make sure our customers can hire and pay compliantly. 

My favorite thing is helping our customers overcome a major fear with remote hiring: The "overhired" employee. I make sure a company's employee doesn't have two jobs. :) 

### Real-time global payroll payments

With our payments partner, I've built a system for our customers to run global payroll compliantly. Because there's a lot of red tape.
